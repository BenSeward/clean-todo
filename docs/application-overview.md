# ðŸ’» Application Overview

This is a fairly simple to-do app. It fetches a couple of to-do items from an open source API and renders them as individual to-do items that you can edit. It also allows you to create new to-do items and mark them as done.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `src/pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
