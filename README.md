# CLEAN React Architecture ⚛️ ⚙️

⚠️ Please note: This is a work in progress, feel free to submit a PR if you have anything to add!

## Introduction

This is a boilerplate repository demonstrating CLEAN architecture in a Next.JS app. This is my attempt at making a future-proof todo app that is easily extensible and loosely follows CLEAN principles.

The main goal for this application is to make a modular application where you can easily swap out dependencies without much friction. Take a look around the repo and check out how I have structured it.

#### Disclaimer:

This is not supposed to be a template, boilerplate or a framework. It is an opinionated guide that shows how to do some things in a certain way. You are not forced to do everything exactly as it is shown here, decide what works best for you and your team and stay consistent with your style.
